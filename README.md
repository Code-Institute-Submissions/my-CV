**GO THROUGH**

The idea behind this project is to bring my CV to a different level,
The main page shows a picture of myself so that reading my introduction
becomes personal ie as if I was reading it to them. 
I want to give potential contacts an idea of whom I am based on my past experiences,
my strudy choices as well as depicting the reasons why I wanted to
change career path.
I am giving the opportunity to each contact to dive into my professional experience
or education path, they have the opportunity to download my CV at
each step which eventually leads to the stay in touch because I would like
those new contact to "follow" my progression throughout the code institute course
to eventually becoming employable.
